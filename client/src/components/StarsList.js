// With the habit component -- render a list of 7 stars. Their value or their key is the date. Needs to be proper so it
// can say ok, today is Tuesday 3/13, so the list of 7 will start on Sunday 3/11.
// If it is a future date -- use a circle
// If it is a past date, check if it has been completed. If yes -- check mark
//                                                       If no -- X (times) mark
// If it is today, check if it has been completed. If yes -- check mark
//                                                 If no -- circle
// On click of the circle, push that completed === true to the habit.stars array
// When the date changes, push completed === false to the habit.stars array

// stars list
// star list item
